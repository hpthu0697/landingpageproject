# landingpageproject

This is my second project that I'll be creating. It's called the landing page project and I will be using the skills I have learned so far and putting it all together. From creating a html file and connecting it with a css file and then using flexbox as one of the main tools to style my project. 

My goal is to take how ever much time I need to create this project from scratch without cheating and looking up the solutions. I know I can find my answers from either googling or going back through the lessons and looking through all the extra resources TOP gave me to read. This is exciting but I am a little nervous as I have to create everything from scratch.
